# BTMA431 Mini Project
My mini project from my BTMA 431 class @ UofC. Done in Dec 2019, wanted to publish to GitHub to share my schoolwork, show my progression, and potentially update.
[Calgary Parties Project](https://sites.google.com/view/bleblanc/projects/btma-431-calgary-parties-mini-project) on my personal website gives a more in-depth analysis on how I created this project.
